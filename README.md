# Redgate's Tech Radar for CORE

See [Redgate's Tech Radar Readme](https://github.com/red-gate/Tech-Radar#readme) for a broad overview of what a tech radar is and how Redgate uses it. This tech radar applies the same ideas and approaches, though there are one or two differences due to the structural differences in CORE. For instance there are no Lead Software Engineers in CORE, so for now, the owners of this repo are the Tech Leads.

Currently the main Tech Radar is published using Thoughtworks but this radar is not currently surfaced in this manner. We have also not yet decided whether CORE's Tech Radar will remain separate to the main Redgate Tech Radar, hence this separate repo. It is possible that in the future these radars will be merged.

The radar is open for anyone within Redgate to contribute. Before contributing please read the [Contributing Guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The recommended way to propose a change or spark a discussion is to open a PR. Contributions should be reviewed and approved by the Tech leads before merging. Comments from all other interested parties are more than welcome.
